	    <h3 id="synopsis">Synopsis</h3>
	    <p>Artistically	inclined Lily struggles	to make it professionally	as a mime, to the chagrin of her
	single father, Miles, who’s just been laid off. Miles’ girlfriend,	Margot, agrees to employ a
	reluctant	Lily part time at her company	to help with the bills . Lily’s disapproval	of Margot causes
	a rift between	her and her father, and his desire for Margot to move in with them further
	complicating	the dynamic.
	While miming on the street corner one day for tips, Lily is approached	by a documentary
	filmmaker	named Leah, who proposes	the concept of creating a documentary	about her. Lily
	accepts,	and before long falls for Leah in the process of creating	the film. Their personal
	relationship	deepens,	complicating	their working relationship. One night, Lily walks in on Leah
	with a boy, then goes home feeling betrayed,	only to hear from Margot that Miles has just died
	in a freak accident.
	As Lily’s world falls apart and she struggles	to pick up the pieces, Margot steps up and tries to
	fill the role of mother for her deceased	partner’s	troubled	daughter. Margot suggests	she would
	be a good agent for Lily, and begins booking appearances	for her. Lily is conflicted	as she tries
	to make her mark as an artist, but is grateful for Margot’s	support.
	Margot soon books a tour in Paris, a longtime	dream of Lily’s, just as she begins reconnecting
	with Leah, causing her to have to choose what’s most important	to her in life, flowering	love or
	her blossoming	career.

	    <p style = "font-size:19px">I was instantly	drawn to the subtlety and truthfulness	of the
	characters	when I first read the screenplay	. It was right then
	when I made it a resolve to take the story universal	through
	cinema </p>
	<p style = "font-size:19px"><img src="./img/Quentin.jpg" align="right" valign="middle" vspace="5" hspace="5"/>
	In “Still to Bloom”, Lily’s life unfolds and blooms in front of us,
	and also through	the lens of Leah, a filmmaker	who is
	captivated	by the dying art form called mime . We also learn
	about Lily’s admiration	for her father, her fondness	for Ella
	Fitzgerald’s	“Goodnight	My Love”, and the simplicity	in life that
	she seeks . While her only outlet is through her mime acts .. and
	it’s a world in which nothing	else matters,	as in life ..
	circumstances	force her to adopt to an evolving world, and to
	accept the realities of her relationships	. Lily is a homage to all
	of us who aspire to be true to ourselves	. The choices she
	makes define who she is even if it comes at the cost of being
	irrelevant	to the people she mimes for on the streets </p>
	<p style = "font-size:19px" >The concrete	details of Lily’s life, her struggles,	and all the real
	humor gives the film an authenticity	that I hope will resonate
	and make it emotional	for all kinds of people . While this story
	is distinct, I do not intend to approach	it as a “small” film or a
	“quirky” film or even an “indie” film . I only get to tell this story
	once, so I want it to be bighearted,	for a big audience,
	progressive	and innovative,	and like Lily – deeply wanting to
	connect with people through her art . This is a story for you </p>
